# grand-canonical-reweighting

1. grand_canonical.ipynb
Derivation of the grand-canonical ensemble and physical meaning of the chemical potential; example with purely entropic system.

2. SHAPEMD-Grand-canonical.ipynb
Notebook by Nicola Calonaci with slight modifications by me to better understand his reweighting algorithm, based on a max. likelihood derivation of the canonical partition functions + matching of the correct chemical potential.

3. delta_mu.ipynb
Notebook with an example of how the chemical potential determines the n. of particles (and so varies with it).

4. basic_functions.py
Python file with basic functions.

5. GC_more_regions.ipynb
Notebook with current main results.

6. long_traj.py and long_traj_shortfile.py
Python files to run long trajectory simulations on the cluster.
